                    <h3>Lauren Glor</h3>
                    <p>My name is Lauren Glor, and I’m 19 years old. I grew up in Miami, Florida, where I spent most of
                        my childhood surrounded by the vibrant energy of the city before moving to Georgia. Currently, I
                        am pursuing my passion for design as an Interaction Design major with a minor in Marketing at
                        Kennesaw State University. I also serve as the vice-president of the Kennesaw State Equestrian
                        Team, a position that has allowed me to develop leadership skills while fostering a deeper
                        connection with the equestrian community. My diverse interests and talents come together in many
                        aspects of my life, with my entrepreneurial spirit leading me to launch my own photography
                        business, Torqued Visuals.

                        Starting Torqued Visuals was a natural progression for me, as it blends my love for colors,
                        which stemmed from my deep appreciation for art, with my passion for cars. Photography has
                        always been a way for me to express myself creatively, and it’s amazing how I can capture the
                        world through my lens, combining these influences into something unique. Whether I’m behind the
                        camera at a photoshoot or leading the equestrian team, I find joy in balancing my artistic side
                        with my academic and professional pursuits, constantly striving to bring a sense of purpose and
                        creativity to everything I do.</p>
